CP_capturedat.xlsx contained the capture data of AstV screened *C. persicillata*, and produces Fig1A in the deposited script CP_Astro.R
ps_131025.rds contains the phyloseq object for the 16S-data generated from *C.perspicillata* fecal samples; The proprocessing is described in detail in Brändel et al. but in case of questions we are happy to share pre-filtered and raw data.
The phyloseq object also includes the taxonomic table (classified based on Silva v138), otu table, sequences, phylogenetic tree and meta data
All necessary packages are detailed in the script, and a reproducible code to construct all main and supplementary figures and tables is included.
